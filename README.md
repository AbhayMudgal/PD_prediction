# PD_prediction
A loan enters default when the borrower fails to pay the lender per the terms in the initial loan agreement. Different organizations have different timeframes before which the provided loan is declared as a default. Another important factor that organizations use to the flag plausible defaultees is Delinquency. If a borrower fails to pay multiple payments they are labelled as delinquents but they can get their original status bu making the payments within a reasonable amount of time. Lenders collect extensive information about a plausible client to filter out the plausible defaultees and decide whether or not to provide their services.
